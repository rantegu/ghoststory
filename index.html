  <p id="descpo">It was a dark, starless <a href="#" class="redd">night</a>. "The house was a mistake", you said, gazing over the mountains, the sea, the countless trees rising from the earth like a <a href="#" class="redd">living end</a>, as a desperate, last breath before dawn. “The sea was a mistake. The view was terrible. My hands, my poor hands...dirty, as soon as you touch them. My body, arid, dry. The city, our last steps, a mistake. The last day we’ve been together. The promises. A mistake“. "<a href="#" class="redd">Come ti pare</a>", I replied. But the words spoke the truth, shiny as the moon that enlightened our faces, shiny as a clean-cut blade.</p>

  <p id="descpo">"I dreamt of you. You were a small child with a pure mind. You spoke with a small, <a href="#" class="redd">thin voice</a>, as quiet as a small village welcomed by the first light of the day. But you spoke as you knew the secret of nature, you spoke the language of gods. You said: <a href="#" class="redd">rivers, silence</a>. And everything went dark".</p>

  <p id="descpo">You closed your eyes. This is the end, you said. <a href="#" class="redd">It’s up to you</a>, I replied, mumbling. A car of young people came by. They were shouting, having fun, kissing. It was the sign that there was a world full of love, out there, waiting for us. But we knew that <a href="#" class="redd">nothing ever ends</a>, that love, love, knows his way to survive; that <a href="#" class="redd">every love story is a ghost story</a>.</p>
